- For this project's development, git and feature branching using Continuous Delivery approach were used.

### Client
http://localhost:8000  

- Run with npm i & npm start after server is up
- React.js (CRA)
- Sass was used to style my react components.
- React-select was used to give our selectors a good look and feel, it would be wise in the future to write a smaller, more lightweight component. Time was of the essence.
- Webpack was used for bundling, hot reloading and chunks
